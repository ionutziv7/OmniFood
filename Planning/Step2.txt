STEP 2: PLAN THE PROJECT

Plan and gather website content

Plan out the sitemap
  
    We will just build a one-page marketing website
    (oftentimes called a langing page), so no sitemap




Define website personality

    Based on the tech-centered target audience, as well as
    the actual product being sold, we will use the startup/
    upbeat personality. We might add some elements of the 
    calm/peaceful personality, since the product is all about
    consumer well-being as well
